Containing all the service classes and methods.

The purpose of a service class is to provide a specific service or 
functionality to other parts of an application. Service classes are 
often responsible for coordinating multiple components or subsystems, 
and encapsulating business logic or domain-specific functionality. They 
are typically larger and more complex than helper classes, and are 
designed to provide a broader service to the application. In the context 
of the __init__.py file, the service classes and methods contained within 
are likely designed to provide specific services or functionality to other 
parts of the application.

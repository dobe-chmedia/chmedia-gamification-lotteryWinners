Containing all the helper classes and methods

The purpose of a helper class is to provide utility functions or methods 
that can be used by other classes or modules. Helper classes are typically 
small and focused on a specific task, such as formatting data or validating 
input. They are often used to encapsulate common functionality that can be 
reused across multiple parts of an application. In the context of the 
__init__.py file, helper classes may be included to provide common 
functionality that can be used by the service classes and methods contained 
within the file.
